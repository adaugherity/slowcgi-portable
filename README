Portable version of OpenBSD slowcgi
===================================
slowcgi(8) is a FastCGI to CGI wrapper, which allows you to run CGI commands
under web servers which only speak FastCGI, e.g. OpenBSD httpd or nginx.

Version: 6.3

Version numbers will match the OpenBSD version; see their history at
<https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/slowcgi/>.


Inspired by the FreeBSD port at <https://github.com/koue/slowcgi>, and
ported to Linux by making use of libbsd <https://libbsd.freedesktop.org/> and
an implementation of getdtablecount(2) by Duncan Overbruck
<https://github.com/Duncaen/lobase>.

The "portable" name is currently not very accurate as this has only been built
on Linux (glibc & GNU make).

All modifications are released under the same license.


Patch series numbering:
